# CoV-MutSpot-SARS-CoV-2-Variant-Mutation-Analyzer
CoV-MutSpot is a bioinformatics tool written in Python that identifies mutation hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 virus variants by comparing them to the reference genome (RefSeq: NC_045512.2). It processes gene-level comparisons and summarizes nucleotide mismatches, helping researchers better understand how COVID-19 variants differ at a genomic level.
